# Wave Function Collapse

The wave function collapse is an algorithm used to simulate the behavior of quantum systems, specifically the phenomenon of wave function collapse. In quantum mechanics a wave function represents a state of a quantum system, it does not represent any finite state, but all possible finite states all at once, this is also known as the 'superposition'. A wave function is said to be collapsed when an observation on the system has been made and the state has converged to a single definite state.
